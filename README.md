# Neo's Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

This is my output on Cloud Resume Challenge hosted on Azure Cloud Platform.

It is a static website hosted on Azure Storage with a visitor counter.

The website is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while the counter is based on Python and Azure Functions. 

I also used Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve requests as HTTPS traffic.
